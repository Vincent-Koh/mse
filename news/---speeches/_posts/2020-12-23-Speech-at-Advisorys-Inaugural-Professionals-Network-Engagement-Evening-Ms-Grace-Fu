#### Speeech by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, at the Advisory's Inaugural Professionals Network Engagement Evening on 23 December 2020 
#### “Building Back Better: A Sustainable Singapore Post-COVID-19

Good evening, everyone. I thank Advisory for organising today’s engagement session, and inviting me to address you.

**The threat of COVID-19 and climate change**

2	All of us will remember this year for the COVID-19 pandemic, and how it devastated lives and economies around the world. The crisis is far from over, as many countries are still experiencing a high number of cases. 

3	However, COVID-19 is not the only urgent challenge we face. The United Nations Environment Programme recently reported that global greenhouse gas emissions reached a new high of 59.1 gigatonnes in 2019, putting the world on track for an average temperature rise of 3 degrees Celsius. Time is running out. Hence, even as we work to overcome and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, we must continue to do our part to fight against climate change. This will require us to put sustainability at the core of our recovery plans and policies. 

**Government’s efforts in sustainability** 

4	Sustainability is not a new undertaking for Singapore. Since independence, we have pursued sustainable development, seeking to balance economic development with environmental protection and social inclusion.  You can see evidence of this in the pervasive network of nature reserves, parks, park connectors, tree-lined roads and other natural areas built within and around our housing estates, in our zero growth rate for cars, and in the prudent way we manage scarce resources like water and energy. In the face of climate change and other challenges, we must do even more, to ensure we continue to develop in a sustainable and socially-inclusive way, and build a climate and resource resilient Singapore for the future. Let me share some examples of how the Government is doing this.

5	To help Singapore transit to a circular economy and become a Zero Waste Nation, we continuously look for synergies to maximise resource use and efficiency, and minimise waste. By 2025, we will complete the construction of Tuas Nexus, which integrates a water reclamation plant with an integrated waste management facility. At Tuas Nexus, food waste will be mixed with used water sludge and co-digested, increasing biogas production by 40 per cent. The plant will generate sufficient electricity to power Tuas Nexus, and excess electricity which can power up to 300,000 four-room HDB flats. The synergies achieved will reduce an estimated 200,000 tonnes of carbon emissions a year, equivalent to taking 42,500 cars off the road. 

6	We are embarking on various strategies to boost local food production, in order to meet our “30 by 30” goal. We are supporting the growth of local agri-food enterprises by harnessing technology and innovation, and will develop the Lim Chu Kang area into a high-tech, productive and resource-efficient agri-food cluster, potentially yielding more than three times its current food production. We have also awarded $39 million through the Singapore Food Agency’s “30 by 30 Express” grant to accelerate local production of vegetables, eggs and fish over the next 24 months.

7	Under the Urban Solutions and Sustainability Domain of the recently announced $25 billion Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 plan, Singapore will deepen our understanding of climate science to address the impacts of climate change. For example, we will conduct climate modelling to understand impacts such as increased urban heat island effect and warming trends on health and food resilience. The Government will also develop capabilities in decarbonisation to meet our climate action goals and to explore opportunities for green growth.

8	Singapore’s pursuit of sustainable development will not just benefit the environment. The MSE family expects to create 55,000 new and upgraded jobs in multiple sectors within the next 10 years. These include opportunities in sectors such as environmental services, waste management, food safety, and the agri-food industry, as well as promising new areas of growth such as carbon services and climate science.

**Businesses have an important role**

9	Business organisations also have an important role to play in Singapore’s journey towards sustainability. By harnessing clean energy, improving energy efficiency and adopting circular economy approaches into their operations, businesses can contribute to Singapore’s emissions reduction target, and at the same time thrive and remain competitive in a carbon- and resource-constrained future. For instance, DBS is embarking on its own solar energy installation, procuring renewable energy and driving energy efficiencies across its organisation to achieve 100 per cent renewable energy adoption for its operations by 2030.

10	Being sustainable is also good for business. Companies can gain significant cost savings over the long term by using less energy and raw materials, and generating less waste. Studies have shown that consumers are increasingly taking notice of companies’ environmental priorities and carbon footprint, and willing to pay a premium for brands that are sustainable and environmentally responsible.

**Conclusion**

11	In June this year, the Government started a series of dialogues called Emerging Stronger Conversations, for Singaporeans to come together and reflect on our COVID-19 experiences.  We shared our hopes and dreams and, in that spirit, the conversations guided us on how we can work together to build our future.

12	The decisions and actions we make today on our post-COVID recovery will determine if we can emerge stronger and be better placed to address the existential threat of climate change. While the journey ahead will not be easy, I am confident that as long as we work together and take collective actions, we will be able to overcome the challenges. Let us work together to do our part for climate change, and build a better and more sustainable future.

Thank you.
